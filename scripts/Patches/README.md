# Patches
### Introduction
In here you'll find a collection of patches that can be used for 'Spark AR Studio'-projects.
Some patches are made by other people and adjusted by us to fit our own specific needs. A reference to the original developer and link are available if necessary.
To use the patches simply download the .arp-file and then drag/drop them inside your 'Spark AR Studio'-project
