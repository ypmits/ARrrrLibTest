# Console Hacking
## Introduction
It is possible to change some of Spark AR Studio's annoying 'features/bugs/midboggling crappy ideas that were shit but still implemented'. One of them is the shear amount of warning you'll get when you use a deprecated API. You can simply turn off every single warning in the console but it's also possible to

### Hiding specific warnings through javascript (Plan A)
Go to the file ScriptingConsole.js
Go to the method: logItem(baser64item, type, interfaceName)<br>
Below this line:
```javascript
let lines = ...;
```
Add the following:
```javascript
if(type == "warning") return;
if(item.includes("[error]")) type = "error";
if(item.includes("[warning]")) type = "warning";
```
Congrats! You can now write your own custom warnings or errors.

### Hiding all warnings through css (Plan B)
If this fails you can always fall back to plan B... 'Hide all warnings'
Go to the app inside the Finder and right click on it.
Choose ‘Show Package Contents’
Navigate to the folder: AR Studio.app/Contents/Resource/ScriptingConsole.html
Look at the following css code:
```css
.warning {
	color: #FFD811;
}
Add: display: none;
Now the css-rule should look like this:
.warning {
	color: #FFD811;
	display: none;
}
```
### You want a custom Background?
You can do whatever you want if you change the html tag. For instance, if you want a custom background that doesn't scroll with the content-text you can do the following
![Custom background](https://github.com/ypmits/ARrrrLib/blob/develop/images/consoleHackingBack.png?raw=true)
``` css
html {
	background-image: url("consoleHackingBack.png"); // <---<<
	background-color: rgb(35, 71, 107); // <----------------<< 
	background-attachment: fixed ; // <----------------------<< Makes sure the image doesn't scroll
	background-position: center; // <-----------------------<< This will center the image
}
```
